# Remix task

I have tried to create 2 apps with PHP (Symfony & Mysql) and Javascript (Express + MySQL).

To fit in the timeframe given in the task and the lack of time on my part i have made some considerations.

- I have very limited testing for the PHP project and none for JS one, however I made sure that the code is easily testable.
- I have opted to use symfony CLI for the PHP project and stick to standard guidelines and utilise the maker bundle to simplify the project.
- The docker setup could use a lot of improvements, such as using kubernetes clusters and making sure both services are visible to each other and have sufficient API Authentication.

Each project has their own README.md file for further explanations in the code itself.

Overall I am not exactly happy with the end result, but provided I have delayed it for over 2 weeks I should submit it rather than spend time to make it pretty. I have spend about 5-6 hours (one all-nighter) to set everything up.
