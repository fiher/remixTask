# User Management App

Because of time constraint I have opted to demonstrate knowledge with Symfony by utilising the Symfony CLI and Maker Bundle.

# Setup

Can be run using `docker compose up`

# Considerations

I have opted to use Symfony tools to generate the skeleton, UI, and Crud for the User entity.

Used standard Symfony guidelines for the Security Bundle and the registration form.

Endpoint used in Order Management is `get` defined in `UserController`

# Future Improvements

I have added just a base set of tests via Maker Bundle. Can be exteded with more detailed tests covering business logic
